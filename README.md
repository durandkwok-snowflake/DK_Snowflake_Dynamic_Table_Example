# DK_Snowflake_Dynamic_Table_Example

Welcome to the Snowflake Dynamic Table Demo! This demo showcases the creation and usage of dynamic tables in Snowflake, focusing on building a pipeline to calculate revenue from orders.

Prerequisites
Before running the demo, make sure you have access to a Snowflake account and have the required privileges to execute the SQL statements provided.

Setup

Display information about the created tables.
Display sample records from the "orders" and "lines" tables.
Build Pipeline - First Step:

Create a dynamic table named "enriched_lines" by joining the "orders," "lines," and "products" tables.
Display records from the "enriched_lines" table.
Build Pipeline - Second Step:

Create another dynamic table named "daily_revenue" by aggregating data from the "enriched_lines" table.
Display records from the "daily_revenue" table.
Dynamic Table History:

View the history of dynamic tables using the information_schema.dynamic_table_graph_history function.
Additional Examples:

Create a dynamic table named "unknown_products" to validate with referential integrity.
Run additional queries to demonstrate the dynamic updating of tables.
Conclusion
This Snowflake Dynamic Table Demo showcases the power and flexibility of dynamic tables for building data pipelines and performing analytical tasks. Feel free to explore and adapt the provided script to suit your specific use cases.
